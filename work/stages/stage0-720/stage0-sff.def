 ;Sprite compression method for 5-bit sprites (32 color). Choose from:
 ;none - No compression. This generates very big files (default).
 ;lz5  - Lossless encoding for 5-bit (32 color) sprites. Compression is slow;

 ;Sprite compression method for 8-bit sprites (256 color). Choose from:
 ;none - No compression. This generates very big files (default).
 ;rle8 - Lossless encoding for sprites with color depth up to 8-bits (256
 ;       colors). Compression and decompression are fast. Compression ratio is
 ;       low. Suitable for images with 33 to 256 colors.
 ;       Advanced: best compression ratio is achieved on images where most of
 ;       the color indices are in the range 0-127 and 192-255.

 ;This option affects the program that uses the sprites.
 ;0 - sprites are to be decompressed when needed (default).
 ;1 - sprites are to be decompressed when loaded from disk. This uses more
 ;    memory when the program runs, but the sprite can be drawn faster. This
 ;    setting is suitable for images that are drawn very frequently, especially
 ;    large ones (eg. in backgrounds).
sprite.decompressonload = 1
 ;0 - Detect identical files only through filename. Duplicate files references
 ;    are linked to the original in order to reduce SFF file size as well as
 ;    memory usage (default).
 ;1 - More thorough comparison of sprite files; actual bytes are compared. Use
 ;    this setting to reduce file size.
 ;    Note: Comparisons are done before cropping.

 ;0 - Do not auto-crop sprites (default).
 ;1 - Automatically crop sprites before adding to them the SFF file. Use this
 ;    setting to reduce file size.

 ;0 - Detect identical files only through filename. Duplicate files references
 ;    are linked to the original in order to reduce SFF file size as well as

 ;1 - More thorough comparison of palette files; actual bytes are compared. Use
 ;    this setting to reduce file size.
pal.detectduplicates = 1
 ;0 - Do not discard duplicate palettes (default).
 ;1 - Discard any duplicate palettes that are detected, instead of linking
 ;    them. Any sprite using a palette that is removed will be set to use the
 ;    non-duplicate palette instead, eg. if palette (1,2) is a duplicate of
 ;    (1,1),  palette (1,2) will be discarded, and any sprites using palette
 ;    (1,2) will be set to use palette (1,1) instead.
 ;    Use this setting to reduce the number of palettes in use, especially
 ;    when adding many palettes through the auto-add palette option
 ;    (sprite.usepal = -1).
